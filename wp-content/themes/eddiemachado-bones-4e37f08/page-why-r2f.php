					<p>Race2fundraise is so flexible, you can use it to create numerous fundraising races; the only limitation is your imagination. After all for every race you can think of there is always the race back to the start!</p>
					
					<p>Here's some ideas of the races you can create to fundraise for your charity:-</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Motor rally across USA</li>
						<li>Sailing around the UK</li>
						<li>Cycling from Land's end to John o'Groats</li>
						<li>Camel racing to the Pyramids</li>
						<li>Air ship race to Australia</li>
						<li>Viking boat race to Denmark</li>
						<li>Dog Sled race to the North Pole</li>
						<li>Elephant racing in India</li>
						<li>Mobility scooter racing through Ireland</li>
						<li>Roller skating through Canada</li>
						<li>Tuk Tuk racing across Asia</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Race2Fundraise is fun for the players and they are being challenged and then entertained for the duration of race and they know that the price they pay to play goes to their chosen fundraising cause. In short they are receiving entertainment for their donation, meaning that they will be happy to do a different race very soon. (It's a bit better than a raffle isn't it?)</p>
